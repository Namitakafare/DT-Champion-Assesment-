# DT-Champion-Assesment-

Steps I Followed to Create the Dashboard:

Score Calculation:
In the original dataset ("DT Data Champion Assignment"), I calculated the basic and advanced screening scores in a separate sheet.

Combining Scores:
I copied the names along with their scores and combined them into the "test2tp" Excel file for further processing.

Data Merging with Python:
Using a Python script, I merged both datasets, creating the output file: "processed_data_case_insensitive.xlsx."

Dashboard Creation:
I added the processed data back into the original dataset ("DT Data Champion Assignment").
Applied conditional formatting to highlight insights and completed Task 1 with a functional dashboard.

Dashboard Automation:
I copied the Task 1 data into "task1.xlsx."
Wrote another Python script to automate the dashboard, generating the final output: "updated_dashboard.xlsx."

Final Touches:
Added all solutions to the last sheet of the original Excel file ("DT Data Champion Assignment") and saved everything in the final solutions folder.
